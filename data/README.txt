# Content:

| Name | Description | 
| :---: | :--- |
| <b>projectdata</b> | Compiled information on each study, treatment, timepoint, and species information. This is a work in progress as we link up our existing species data with global trait databases and our existing site coordinates with global climate and topography databases. | 
| <b>metadata</b> | Description of all sheets in projectdata file, including description of each variable and units of measurement where applicable. Also includes metadata for vegetation results sheets. |
| <i>vegresults</i> | Folder containing all vegetation results as individual files split by study. This is a work in progress as we finish processing landscape-level studies and community data. Not that there are two subfolders: "Additional", which contains one file of untransformed data (GAZP70 had unclear areal measurements); and, "Missing community data" <b>which contains processed data</b>, but we have not fully processed the available community aspects of those data. | 
| <i>contributed_literature</i> | Folder containing publications that were contributed as datasets. Can be used to investigate individual projects as necessary. | 

# NOTES:

* Vegetation results for the following projects were omitted: 34, 35, 62, and 91.  
* Site details from projects: 34 and 35 were omitted.
